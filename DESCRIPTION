Description: This package provides an efficient process to call diplotypes from genotypes based on allele definition tables provided by 
  PharmGKB. You provide the genotypes in .csv format and genes of interest and package name will call diplotypes, activity scores and 
  metabolizer phenotypes. In the case where an alternate diplotype is returned, activity scores and phenotypes are only based off the main diplotype call, 
  the information is not applicable to the alternate diplotype.
